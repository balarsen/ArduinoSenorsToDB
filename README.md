# ArduinoSenorsToDB
My example program to collect Arduino sensor data and transmit and store in a DB

Sensors and parts

- Arduino uno
- Adafruit Chronodat V2.1
- Adafruit Lux Sensor TSL2561
- Ehternet Shield (will be wi-fi eventually)
- Micro SD card (2 gig)


Eventual capability:
- Arduino stores sensor data on a variable cadence. 
- Data reported via UDP
- Past data can be requested via computer
- Settings set via computer
- Data that hits the computer is stored in a MongoDB database
- Then the data is plotted and displayed in realish time via pandas or Plotly
